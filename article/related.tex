The importance of recommending differently to each user has recently being
addresed in the scientific community \cite{qualiPred, helpPred}. They focus on
review assesment, while our work is directed to reviewer recommendation. We
believe users's opinion is the most important factor when finding a review
useful.

Reviews, in general, are more volatile than reviewers. Recent studies found that
review composition influence ranges from other's opinion to weather \cite{demog,
wasHelp}. The aggregated pattern of a reviewer, then, is a more solid
information to consider when performing recommendation.
