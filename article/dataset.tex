\section{Dataset}
The data used consists of a set of reviews, business, users and related content
of Yelp's website regarding the metropolitan area of Phoenix released for a
challenge\footnote{www.yelp.com/dataset\_challenge}. There are $15,585$
businesses, $70,817$ users and $335,022$ reviews, which covers a period from
$2005-02-01$ until $2014-01-28$.

Yelp also contains an online social network (OSN), thus users are able to be
friends of each other. This network, however, is not the main purpose of the
platform and does not entirely represent the true interaction between
individuals --- sometimes the motivation of connection is not really a
friendship, but similar businesses preferences and reviewing behavior. A great
part of the users, however, does not even have any friends: only $30,255$ of
them are socially connected. This proves that this network is not enough for
discovering reference reviewers, demanding an extrapolation with unobserved
edges.
