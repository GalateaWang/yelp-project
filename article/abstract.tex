Online ratings are nowadays one of the most trusted sources of consumer confidence when they need to decide which business to choose. In a matter of fact, reviews have become so abundant that many times the task of deciding upon whether or not to elect a business is getting increasingly difficult -- each person has their own values and intrinsic characteristics that contribute to forming an opinion. In this work, we discriminate relevant users from a review website considering the perspective of a second user. This way, we will be able to infer what would be the individuals that think alike certain user and recommend their reviews amongst a plethora of diverse opinions.
